=== Card Game Engine - Progress Notes ===

--- Session: 2026-02-06 (Agent handling features #4 and #5) ---

COMPLETED:
- Feature #4: No mock data patterns in codebase - PASSING
  - Ran all required grep scans across server/src and client/src
  - Zero hits for: globalThis, devStore, mockData, testData, fakeData, sampleData, dummyData
  - Zero hits for: TODO.*real, TODO.*database, STUB, MOCK
  - Zero hits for: isDevelopment, isDev, process.env.NODE_ENV.*development
  - Zero hits for: new Map(), new Set() (in-memory stores)
  - Zero hits for: json-server, miragejs, msw in package.json files
  - Created unique test data via API, verified it appears, deleted and confirmed removal

- Feature #5: Backend API queries real database - PASSING
  - Started server with Fastify logger enabled
  - Verified SQL query logs appear for every API endpoint:
    - GET /api/games -> [SQL] SELECT * FROM games ORDER BY updated_at DESC
    - POST /api/games -> [SQL] INSERT INTO games (id, name, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    - DELETE /api/games/:id -> [SQL] DELETE FROM games WHERE id = ?
    - GET /api/health -> [SQL] Health check: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_master
  - All routes use getDb() which returns a real better-sqlite3 Database instance
  - No mock data patterns detected

NOTES:
- PostgreSQL is not available in this environment; project uses SQLite (better-sqlite3) instead
- Database file: server/data/card-game-engine.db
- Fixed init.sh to reference server/src/index.js instead of server/index.js (old entry point)
- Project structure: monorepo with server/ (Fastify) and client/ (React + Vite)
- Backend runs on port 3001, Frontend on port 5173

CURRENT STATUS: 2/44 features passing (Features #4 and #5)

WHAT TO WORK ON NEXT:
- Features #1-3 (database connection, schema, persistence) should also pass given the current codebase
- Game management features (start screen, CRUD operations)
- Card import system
- Game table canvas with PixiJS
