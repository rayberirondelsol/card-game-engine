=== Card Game Engine - Progress Notes ===

--- Session: 2026-02-06 (Agent handling features #4 and #5) ---

COMPLETED:
- Feature #4: No mock data patterns in codebase - PASSING
  - Ran all required grep scans across server/src and client/src
  - Zero hits for: globalThis, devStore, mockData, testData, fakeData, sampleData, dummyData
  - Zero hits for: TODO.*real, TODO.*database, STUB, MOCK
  - Zero hits for: isDevelopment, isDev, process.env.NODE_ENV.*development
  - Zero hits for: new Map(), new Set() (in-memory stores)
  - Zero hits for: json-server, miragejs, msw in package.json files
  - Created unique test data via API, verified it appears, deleted and confirmed removal

- Feature #5: Backend API queries real database - PASSING
  - Started server with Fastify logger enabled
  - Verified SQL query logs appear for every API endpoint:
    - GET /api/games -> [SQL] SELECT * FROM games ORDER BY updated_at DESC
    - POST /api/games -> [SQL] INSERT INTO games (id, name, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    - DELETE /api/games/:id -> [SQL] DELETE FROM games WHERE id = ?
    - GET /api/health -> [SQL] Health check: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_master
  - All routes use getDb() which returns a real better-sqlite3 Database instance
  - No mock data patterns detected

--- Session: 2026-02-06 (Agent handling features #1, #2, #3) ---

COMPLETED:
- Feature #1: Database connection established - PASSING
  - Health endpoint returns { status: "ok", database: { status: "connected", type: "sqlite", tables: 6 } }
  - Returns HTTP 200 status code
  - Server logs show successful database connection on startup

- Feature #2: Database schema applied correctly - PASSING
  - All 6 required tables present: games, categories, card_backs, cards, setups, save_states
  - All columns match spec: correct types, PKs, NOT NULLs, defaults
  - Foreign key constraints verified: ON DELETE CASCADE for game_id refs, ON DELETE SET NULL for optional refs
  - Verified via direct SQLite PRAGMA queries on the database file

- Feature #3: Data persists across server restart - PASSING
  - Created test game FINAL_PERSIST_TEST_99999 via POST /api/games
  - Killed server process (verified port freed)
  - Restarted server
  - Verified test data survived restart (real SQLite file persistence)
  - Cleaned up test data after verification
  - No mock data patterns found in codebase (grep verified)

FIXES:
- Fixed init.sh: changed `npx --prefix client vite` to `npm run dev --prefix client`
- Removed temporary verification scripts (verify-schema.mjs, start-client.mjs)

NOTES:
- PostgreSQL is not available in this environment; project uses SQLite (better-sqlite3) instead
- Database file: server/data/card-game-engine.db
- Project structure: monorepo with server/ (Fastify ESM) and client/ (React + Vite)
- Backend runs on port 3001, Frontend on port 5173
- Server uses ESM modules (import/export), NOT CommonJS (require)

CURRENT STATUS: 5/44 features passing (Features #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)

WHAT TO WORK ON NEXT:
- Game management UI features (start screen, create/edit/delete games)
- Card import system
- Game table canvas with PixiJS

HOW TO START SERVERS:
- Backend: node server/src/index.js (port 3001)
- Frontend: npm run dev --prefix client (port 5173)
- Or: chmod +x init.sh && ./init.sh (both)
